# elevator-that-takes-only-5-people
## by Ahmed Elrawi & Tasneem Sherif 
we are facing a pandamic, it's corona virus that sperate us, so we need to make distance between 
people, to make this we made this project, this is a project for a space that takes only 5 people on 
it than make a sound and close the door
it can be an elevator or a store or many more places, and we need it in every single place.
## preview:
to start the project you need to use the *button*, 
*the lights on this project* is red or green if the 
light truns *green* than there is a space for more peaple, if it *red* than the door will be closed and there
is no more people can enter,*the motor* is the way the door opens and closes, so when there is five people 
in the room the motor will work and closes the door, if not the motor is off and the door is open.
*buzzer*
